# Blood-cell-Counter-using-Image-processing
This  code counts the number of white blood cells, red blood cells in an
image.It also gives the overlapping cell regions in the image. WBCs are much larger, scattered
than RBCs in a microscopic image of a blood smear. We have used basic image processing
techniques such as: rgb to grayscale conversion, adjusting the contrast, binarizing the image,
segmentation and other morphological operations such as opening, connected
components,region props etc. Thus we will be able to separate WBCs and RBCs and count
them.
